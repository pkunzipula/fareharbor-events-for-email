# fareharbor-events-for-email
Grab all events on Green Valley Range's Farharbor calendar feed and display it as a newsletter template ready for Mailchimp!

This is 1/4th of a suite of apps I built to reduce the paper shuffling that used to consume too many days a month.

The Events list grabs all our company's events for the date range you specify, and returns them in an email-friendly HTML template that you can copy and paste into Mailchimp in a matter of 1 minute.

This process used to take two browser windows and a couple of hours pulling individual event details out of the calendar. Life changed when Fareharbor made their API available to me.

The 3 other buttons access our internal customer database, so they are disabled for this project.

Thanks for checking it out!
